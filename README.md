# DATE NIGHT

Jeff Jing, Mari Kaku, Ashley Strandberg and Mark Horsfall teamed up to complete the week 7 group project as part of a full-stack coding boot camp in which we were all participants.

The objective was to utilize the knowledge and skills gained during the first 6 weeks of the course, emcompassing HTML, CSS, JS, the document object model (DOM), third party APIs such as JQuery and Bootstrap as well as server side APIs chosen specifically for our application.

## project outline

Our concept was to create an application that utilizes user input to present a series of choices for dining, film and local area activities that closely suit the user.

## project criteria

We were asked to fulfill the following requirements:

Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap (we used Bulma).

Be deployed to GitHub Pages (see below for deployed application).

Be interactive (users are able to enter various inputs to drive the application result).

Use at least two server-side APIs (OMDB and TicketMaster have been utilized - Leaflet is 'in progress').

Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (no window methods were used).

Use client-side storage to store persistent data (incomplete).

Be responsive (responsiveness via media queries in Bulma).

Have a polished UI (in progress).

Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.) (see repo).

Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application) (see README).

Finally, you must add your project to the portfolio that you created in Module 2 (complete).
