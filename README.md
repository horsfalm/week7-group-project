# week7-group-project

Jeff Jing, Mari Kaku, Ashley Strandberg and Mark Horsfall teamed up to complete the week 7 group project as part of a full-stack coding boot camp in which we were all participants.

The objective was to utilize the knowledge and skills gained during the first 6 weeks of the course, emcompassing HTML, CSS, JS, the document object model (DOM), third party APIs such as JQuery and Bootstrap as well as server side APIs chosen specifically for our application.

## project outline

Our concept was to create an application that utilizes user input to present a series of choices for dining, film and local area activities that closely suit the user.
